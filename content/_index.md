Hello, my name is Emile Hohnadel and this is my personal webpage.

I am a Postdoc in the [ELAN team](https://team.inria.fr/elan/)
at [INRIA Grenoble-Rhône-Alpes](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-university-grenoble-alpes)
working with [Florence Bertails-Descoubes](https://elan.inrialpes.fr/people/bertails/)
and [Thibaut Métivet](https://tmetivet.perso.math.cnrs.fr/)
on the physical simulations of fibrous materials in 2D and 3D.
This is a continuation of my PhD thesis made under their supervision, which I defended in July 2025.

I am interested in developing efficient numerical modelling of complex physical and mechanical behaviours.

<!-- In my free time, I enjoy cooking (especially pastry), going to the cinema and reading. -->
