Hello, my name is Emile Hohnadel and this is my personal webpage.

I am a PhD student in the [ELAN team](https://team.inria.fr/elan/)
at [INRIA Grenoble-Rhône-Alpes](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-university-grenoble-alpes)
under the supervision of [Florence Bertails-Descoubes](https://elan.inrialpes.fr/people/bertails/)
and [Thibaut Métivet](https://tmetivet.perso.math.cnrs.fr/).

I am working on the physical simulations of fibrous materials in 2D and 3D.

<!-- In my free time, I enjoy cooking (especially pastry), going to the cinema and reading. -->
